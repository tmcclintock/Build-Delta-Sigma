# Build-Delta-Sigma

This is a utility that is built from Tom McClintock's Delta Sigma code found here:

https://github.com/tmcclintock/Delta-Sigma

Unlike the above, this code takes in either a halo-matter or a matter-matter correlation function and builds a weak lensing signal (DeltaSigma aka gamma) from it.

This code can also generate mock miscentered weak lensing signals given a mean miscentered length "Rmis" and a miscentered fraction "fmis".
